# PelaajaAPI

This is the final assignment of the backend course.

HOXX! This is made with Python 3.9.13

## Install

First you need to create venv and activate it. 
If you use Visual Studio Code, I advise to use their own Python: Create Enviroment-thing,
but if you don't use it, I hope that this link will help you:

https://docs.python.org/3.10/library/venv.html

When you have venv and you had activate it, you can install rest with

```
pip install -r req.txt
```

## Run

```
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

## Go to

http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs


That's all, have a nice time!

xoxo
